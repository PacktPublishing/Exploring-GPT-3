# Exploring-GPT-3

This repository contains all of the code examples from the book Exploring GPT-3. Most of the code examples are written in both JavaScript and Python. However, the code for Chapter 10 was only written in JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenAI API key. You can get one at https://openai.com/api/
- A Replit.com account. You can get one at https://replit.com/

## Running the Examples

Most of the examples require that you have an environment variable set to your OpenAI API key. This is done by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Or, in replit.com, you can click on the padlock icon on the left-side menu to create a 'secret' named `OPPENAI_API_KEY` with the value set to your OpenAI API Key.
